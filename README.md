# PopCob - the World's First* COBOL-60 Interpreter

## Acknowledgement

This publication is based on the COBOL System developed in 1959 by a volunatary committee composed of government users and computer manufacturers. The organizations participating in the original development were:

* Air Materiel Command, U. S. Air Force
* Bureau of Standards, Department of Commerce
* Datamatic Division, Minneapolis-Honeywell Corporation
* David Taylor Model Basin, Bureau of Ships, U. S. Navy
* ElectroData Division, Burroughs Corporation
* International Business Machines Corporation
* Radio Corporation of America
* Remington-Rand Division of Sperry-Rand, Inc.
* Sylvania Electric Products, Inc.

These initial sepcifications for the COBOL language are the result of contributions made by all of the above-mentioned organizations and no warranty expressed or implied, as to the accuracy and functioning of the programming system and language is made by any contributor or by the committee and no responsibility is assumed by any contributor or by the committee in connection therewith.

It is reasonable to expect that many improvement and additions will be made to COBOL. Every effort will be made to insure that improvements and corrections will be made in an orderly fashion making proper provision not to invalidate existing users' investments in programming. However, this can be positively assured only by individual implementors.

Procedures have been established for the maintenance of COBOL. Inquiries concerning the procedures and the methods for proposing changes should be directed to the Executive Committee of the Conference on Data Systems Languages.
